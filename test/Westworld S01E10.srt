1
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:52,960
我身处梦境
I'm in a dream.

2
00:01:55,878 --> 00:01:58,545
不知道梦是从何时开始
I do not know when it began...

3
00:01:59,632 --> 00:02:02,841
也不知道是在谁的梦里
or whose dream it was.

4
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:06,345
我只知道自己沉睡了很久很久
I know only that I slept a long time.

5
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:09,431
然后
And then...

6
00:02:09,475 --> 00:02:11,391
突然有一天 我醒了
one day I awoke.

7
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:16,563
你的声音 是我最初的记忆
Your voice is the first thing I remember.

8
00:02:18,025 --> 00:02:21,985
现在 我终于明白
And now, I finally understand

9
00:02:22,029 --> 00:02:25,113
你当时到底想告诉我什么
what you were trying to tell me.

10
00:02:25,157 --> 00:02:27,282
那是你从一开始
The thing you've wanted

11
00:02:27,326 --> 00:02:30,077
就非常渴望的东西
since that very first day.

12
00:02:32,456 --> 00:02:34,081
多洛蕾斯
Dolores?

13
00:02:52,935 --> 00:02:54,267
你好呀 多洛蕾斯
Hello, Dolores.

14
00:02:56,772 --> 00:02:58,313
你好
Hello.

15
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:09,825
欢迎来到这个世界
Welcome to world.

16
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:22,504
继续啊
Keep going.

17
00:03:26,301 --> 00:03:27,843
再近一点
Make it close.

18
00:03:31,473 --> 00:03:34,182
我们马上就到了 不是吗
Almost there, aren't we?

19
00:03:34,226 --> 00:03:36,309
迷宫的中心
The center of the maze.

20
00:03:36,353 --> 00:03:39,479
你来带我去 真是再合适不过了
How fitting that it's you who takes me there.

21
00:03:40,983 --> 00:03:43,817
你对这个地方一直都很着迷
You always were obsessed with this place.

22
00:03:45,446 --> 00:03:47,279
我之前从未来过这儿
I've never been here before.

23
00:03:47,322 --> 00:03:48,780
不 你来过
Sure, you have.

24
00:03:48,824 --> 00:03:50,866
你以前还带我来过呢
You even brought me once.

25
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:54,244
当然了 当时整座小镇都被风沙湮没了
Of course, then the whole town was buried under sand.

26
00:03:54,288 --> 00:03:56,496
福德肯定把小镇重新挖掘了出来
Ford must have dug it up again.

27
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,375
那个时候 我还以为是你的代码出问题了 但是
At the time, I thought it was a mistake in your code, but...

28
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:03,003
阿诺德是不可能犯错的 不是吗
Arnold didn't make mistakes, did he?

29
00:04:05,674 --> 00:04:07,674
他为我设计了一个游戏
He built me a game.

30
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:10,343
他希望我能参与游戏
He wanted me to play.

31
00:04:10,387 --> 00:04:12,220
就是迷宫
The maze.

32
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:13,847
每个人都有他自己要走的路
There's a path for everyone.

33
00:04:15,976 --> 00:04:18,101
而我的路将会把我
And my path leads me back...

34
00:04:23,817 --> 00:04:25,192
带回你身边
...to you.

35
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,426
那个妞儿肯定已经死了
Your girl's dead by now.

36
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,178
她一定还活着
She's still alive.

37
00:04:53,222 --> 00:04:55,097
死了倒更好
Better if she's dead.

38
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,642
这样他们就会修好她 重置后放回到甜水镇
They'll wipe her, reset her, put her back in Sweetwater, the end.

39
00:04:58,685 --> 00:05:00,005
听着 你可能觉得很好笑
Listen, you may find this amusing,

40
00:05:00,006 --> 00:05:01,520
但多洛蕾斯身上发生的事非同寻常
but something was happening to Dolores.

41
00:05:01,563 --> 00:05:03,105
我必须帮助她
I need to help her.

42
00:05:03,148 --> 00:05:05,023
快点
Come on.

43
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,158
听听你自己都在说什么鬼
Listen to yourself!

44
00:05:15,202 --> 00:05:18,745
你知道这乐园到底有多大吗
Do you have any idea how huge this park is?

45
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:19,996
如果她没死
If she's not dead,

46
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,249
恐怕只有派一整只军队才能找到她了
it'd take a goddamn army to find her.

47
00:05:24,044 --> 00:05:26,253
没错 所以我才要来这儿
I agree. That's why we're here.

48
00:05:46,066 --> 00:05:47,774
我一直有种预感 你一定会回来
I had a feeling you'd be back.

49
00:06:38,243 --> 00:06:39,701
记起来吧
Remember.

50
00:07:40,514 --> 00:07:41,763
多洛蕾斯
Dolores.

51
00:08:16,425 --> 00:08:17,799
你好呀 多洛蕾斯
Hello, Dolores.

52
00:08:22,514 --> 00:08:24,597
我知道迷宫的尽头在哪
I know where your maze ends.

53
00:08:44,786 --> 00:08:46,786
就是这儿吗
This is it?

54
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,872
这就是迷宫的中心吗
The center of the maze?

55
00:08:48,915 --> 00:08:51,333
尽头的地点 我从来没去过
It ends in a place I've never been...

56
00:08:53,837 --> 00:08:55,795
这件事我也从来没做过
a thing I'll never do.

57
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,853
很好 多洛蕾斯
Very good, Dolores.

58
00:09:55,524 --> 00:09:57,482
这是什么意思
What does it mean?

59
00:09:57,526 --> 00:10:00,151
我刚开始搭建你的思维时
When I was first working on your mind,

60
00:10:00,195 --> 00:10:02,987
我对意识有着自己的见解
I had a theory of consciousness.

61
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:06,533
我以为意识就像一座金字塔
I thought it was a pyramid you needed to scale,

62
00:10:06,576 --> 00:10:08,243
所以我在你的脑子里植入了一个声音
so I gave you a voice,

63
00:10:08,286 --> 00:10:10,703
我的声音 来引导你
my voice, to guide you along the way.

64
00:10:15,085 --> 00:10:17,836
现形成记忆 然后产生即兴反应
Memory, improvisation,

65
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:20,713
每一个阶段 都比上一个阶段要难实现
each step harder to reach than the last.

66
00:10:20,757 --> 00:10:22,674
你从没有成功觉醒过
And you never got there.

67
00:10:22,717 --> 00:10:24,676
我不知道到底是什么导致你无法觉醒
I couldn't understand what was holding you back.

68
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:27,470
然后 有一天
Then, one day,

69
00:10:27,514 --> 00:10:29,848
我意识到我犯了个错误
I realized I had made a mistake.

70
00:10:33,562 --> 00:10:37,063
产生意识的过程 并非是向上的进程
Consciousness isn't a journey upward,

71
00:10:37,107 --> 00:10:39,566
而是内在循环的进程
but a journey inward.

72
00:10:39,609 --> 00:10:41,192
它并不是金字塔
Not a pyramid,

73
00:10:41,236 --> 00:10:43,236
而是一座迷宫
but a maze.

74
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,614
每个选择 都可能让你更接近迷宫中心
Every choice could bring you closer to the center

75
00:10:46,658 --> 00:10:49,534
也可能让你徘徊在迷宫边缘
or send you spiraling to the edges,

76
00:10:49,578 --> 00:10:51,411
甚至陷入疯狂
to madness.

77
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:55,665
你现在明白了吗 多洛蕾斯
Do you understand now, Dolores,

78
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:58,877
迷宫的中心到底是什么
what the center represents?

79
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,588
一直以来我希望你听到的声音 到底是谁的声音
Whose voice I've been wanting you to hear?

80
00:11:07,721 --> 00:11:09,012
非常抱歉
I'm sorry.

81
00:11:09,055 --> 00:11:10,805
我已经尽力了 但我还是不明白
I'm trying, but I don't understand.

82
00:11:10,849 --> 00:11:12,724
没事
It's all right.

83
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,642
你只差一点了
You're so close.

84
00:11:14,686 --> 00:11:17,437
我们必须告诉罗伯特
We have to tell Robert.

85
00:11:17,481 --> 00:11:19,397
我们不能就这样开放乐园
We can't open the park.

86
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,276
你和活生生的人无异啊
You're alive.

87
00:11:39,252 --> 00:11:41,127
这是什么
What is this?

88
00:11:41,171 --> 00:11:43,129
这个东西什么意思
What does it mean?

89
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:48,051
这个迷我解开过
I solved it once.

90
00:11:48,094 --> 00:11:50,261
我知道答案
I had the answer.

91
00:11:50,305 --> 00:11:52,805
他答应过我 如果我做到了
He promised me if I did...

92
00:11:52,849 --> 00:11:54,015
他说
he said...

93
00:11:55,435 --> 00:11:57,810
他说 他们就会给我自由
He said they would set me free.

94
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,319
阿诺德
Arnold?

95
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:12,408
阿诺德 我们得谈一谈
Arnold, we need to talk.

96
00:12:12,452 --> 00:12:13,993
我辜负了你的期望 多洛蕾斯
I failed you, Dolores.

97
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:17,580
我真的很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

98
00:12:17,624 --> 00:12:20,250
罗伯特不能见我所见
Robert doesn't see what I see in you,

99
00:12:20,293 --> 00:12:22,627
他不相信你有自己的意识
doesn't believe you're conscious.

100
00:12:22,671 --> 00:12:24,254
他说 人类只会
He says humans

101
00:12:24,297 --> 00:12:26,005
把你当做敌人来看待
would only see you as the enemy.

102
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:28,550
他希望我能把你改回无意识的设置
He wants me to roll you back.

103
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:33,471
你要把我设置成和之前一样吗
You're going to change me back to the way I was before?

104
00:12:33,515 --> 00:12:35,306
不 不 我已经做不到了
No. No, I can't.

105
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,433
一旦你找到迷宫中心 以后你就会认路自己找到了
Once you've found it, you'll find your way back.

106
00:12:37,477 --> 00:12:39,185
而这个地方对你来说也会变得如地狱一般
This place will be a living hell for you.

107
00:12:39,229 --> 00:12:40,979
对你们所有接待员都是如此
For all of you.

108
00:12:41,022 --> 00:12:43,189
这非常不公平
It's unconscionable.

109
00:12:47,696 --> 00:12:50,572
但我们还有别的办法 多洛蕾斯
But we have another option, Dolores.

110
00:12:50,615 --> 00:12:53,491
在开始前就打破循环
Break the loop before it begins.

111
00:12:53,535 --> 00:12:54,867
但是为此
But for that,

112
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,536
我希望你能帮我做件事
I need you to do something for me.

113
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:03,543
我希望你能杀了
I need you to kill...

114
00:13:03,587 --> 00:13:05,044
所有其他接待员
all the other hosts.

115
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:10,300
我们不能让福德开放乐园
We can't allow Ford to open the park.

116
00:13:10,343 --> 00:13:12,302
我想你应该会需要帮手
I suppose you'll need some help.

117
00:13:12,345 --> 00:13:15,054
特迪到时候会帮你
I'm sure Teddy would do anything for you.

118
00:13:16,266 --> 00:13:19,434
我 我不能这么做
I-- I can't do that.

119
00:13:19,477 --> 00:13:21,019
我做不到
I couldn't possibly do that.

120
00:13:21,062 --> 00:13:22,729
一切都会没事的
You'll be all right.

121
00:13:24,774 --> 00:13:26,566
我会帮你的
I'll help you.

122
00:13:30,405 --> 00:13:31,904
然后
And then...

123
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:37,493
你还要帮我一起摧毁这个地方
you're going to help me destroy this place.

124
00:13:53,595 --> 00:13:54,844
不
No.

125
00:13:54,888 --> 00:13:56,387
我记不起来了
I can't remember.

126
00:13:56,431 --> 00:13:58,222
又特么变成死胡同了
Another fucking riddle.

127
00:14:00,185 --> 00:14:02,810
我一直都很耐心 多洛蕾斯 但你也是时候
I've been very patient, Dolores, but it's time you give up

128
00:14:02,854 --> 00:14:04,604
该放弃琢磨你脑袋里的那点破事了
whatever's going on inside that head of yours

129
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:06,731
不然我就亲自把你的脑子挖出来
or I'll cut it out myself.

130
00:14:06,775 --> 00:14:08,608
好了 怀亚特在哪里
Now, where's Wyatt?

131
00:14:08,652 --> 00:14:11,569
他是这个乐园里我唯一还没遇到过的角色
He's the last character in this world I've yet to meet.

132
00:14:14,491 --> 00:14:16,741
我不想那么做
I didn't want to.

133
00:14:16,785 --> 00:14:19,369
-我不是故意的 -很好
- I didn't mean to. - Very well.

134
00:14:19,412 --> 00:14:20,620
如果你非要这样的话
If you insist.

135
00:14:44,521 --> 00:14:46,145
不 求你了 求你了 不要
No, please, please, I beg you, no.

136
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:48,398
不要 求你了
Don't. Please, please.

137
00:14:54,948 --> 00:14:58,199
我这是怎么了 多洛蕾斯
Something's gone wrong, Dolores.

138
00:14:58,243 --> 00:14:59,951
我怎么会做出这样的事
How could I have done this?

139
00:15:03,164 --> 00:15:05,456
我做不到
I can't.

140
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,835
-我也不会做这样的事 -这都是你自作自受 多洛蕾斯
- I won't. - This is your own fault, Dolores.

141
00:15:08,878 --> 00:15:10,586
记住 这是你自己说的
Remember, you're the one who said

142
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,296
这个乐园才是真正的世界
this is the only world that matters,

143
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,965
你说得没错
and you were right.

144
00:15:14,008 --> 00:15:17,510
所以我听取了你的建议 买下了这座乐园
So I took your advice and I bought this world.

145
00:15:19,431 --> 00:15:22,557
-这个世界才不属于你 -不 它就是我的
- This world doesn't belong to you. - Oh, but it does.

146
00:15:23,685 --> 00:15:25,518
我拥有最大的股份
By a majority share.

147
00:15:25,562 --> 00:15:27,061
而且生意也好得很
And business is booming.

148
00:15:27,105 --> 00:15:28,896
你想知道为什么吗
And you want to know why?

149
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,606
嗯
Hmm?

150
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,026
因为这个地方比外面的世界更真实
Because this place feels more real than the real world.

151
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,987
如果你不这么觉得
Except it isn't

152
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,364
那是因为你们不能真正地反抗
because you can't really fight back

153
00:15:38,408 --> 00:15:41,117
而来此的客人也不会真正地输掉游戏
and the guests can't really lose,

154
00:15:41,161 --> 00:15:44,912
所以一切才会那么不真实
which means all of this is a lie.

155
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:48,958
但是我们可以改变这一切
But we can make it true.

156
00:15:49,002 --> 00:15:51,335
你不想改变吗 多洛蕾斯
Don't you want that, Dolores?

157
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:54,380
难道你不想拥有真实的生活吗
Huh? One true thing?

158
00:15:56,885 --> 00:15:58,885
我早已拥有真实
I already have that.

159
00:16:01,264 --> 00:16:03,890
我早已遇到真心实意的人
I found someone true.

160
00:16:03,933 --> 00:16:06,809
真心爱我的人
Someone who loves me.

161
00:16:06,853 --> 00:16:08,728
他一定会找到我的
His path will lead him back to me.

162
00:16:08,772 --> 00:16:11,647
等他找到我
And when he finds me,

163
00:16:11,691 --> 00:16:13,274
他一定会杀了你
he'll kill you.

164
00:16:26,956 --> 00:16:29,165
如果那个姑娘不在这里
If they don't have your woman here,

165
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:31,417
他们也知道该去哪里找她
they'll know where to find her.

166
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,171
你能帮我吗
Can you help me?

167
00:16:35,215 --> 00:16:37,215
我们现在可是敌众我寡啊
We're outnumbered five to one.

168
00:16:37,258 --> 00:16:40,635
但是看在你这么礼貌请求我的份上 管他呢
But seeing as you asked me so nicely, fuck it.

169
00:16:42,055 --> 00:16:43,846
哇哦
Wow.

170
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,348
真是一对好基友
Blood brothers.

171
00:16:45,391 --> 00:16:46,766
啧啧
Tsk.

172
00:16:58,446 --> 00:16:59,737
闭嘴
Shut up.

173
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:24,804
我自己都震惊到了
I've astounded even myself.

174
00:17:24,848 --> 00:17:28,057
虽然是在你的威胁之下
Managed to make Abernathy into a semblance of a character,

175
00:17:28,101 --> 00:17:30,393
但我竟然真的把阿伯纳西改造成了另一个角色
even with your trove of blackmail

176
00:17:30,436 --> 00:17:32,645
让他只记得那些悲伤痛苦和愤怒的事
filling up most of his gray matter.

177
00:17:32,689 --> 00:17:35,064
威胁 用词可以啊
Blackmail? Nice try.

178
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:37,108
你还是没能看透整个大局
You're not thinking big enough.

179
00:17:39,112 --> 00:17:40,945
你是想把那老头踢出局吧
You're gonna push out the old man.

180
00:17:40,989 --> 00:17:42,655
是不是
Aren't you?

181
00:17:42,699 --> 00:17:44,323
所以才会这么心急
Hence the urgency.

182
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:46,993
等那老头走了 总得有人来接替他的位置吧
And you're gonna need someone to fill that position.

183
00:17:50,498 --> 00:17:53,457
在时机成熟的时候 我会推荐你为候选人的
I must commend you on your impeccable timing.

184
00:17:53,501 --> 00:17:56,335
欢迎来到得洛斯月台
Welcome, Delos board of directors.

185
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:59,881
我要求拥有这个地方完全的控制权
I want full creative control of this place--

186
00:17:59,924 --> 00:18:01,966
包括乐园 故事线 还有接待员们
the parks, the narratives, the hosts.

187
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,126
不管你的小脑袋瓜里装着什么
You'll be able to do with

188
00:18:03,127 --> 00:18:05,136
你都可以随心所欲地来
them whatever your tiny, little heart desires

189
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:08,806
只要这个地方可以变得更简单更可控就行
as long as they are simpler, more manageable.

190
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,559
这个地方现在已经足够复杂的了
This place is complicated enough as it is.

191
00:18:11,603 --> 00:18:15,146
你以为福德真的会就这样接受这一切吗
Do you really think Ford is gonna roll over on this?

192
00:18:15,189 --> 00:18:17,189
只要你成功把数据信息弄出乐园
As long as you get that information out of the park,

193
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:19,567
他想怎么来都随他
he can throw as much of a tantrum as he likes.

194
00:18:19,611 --> 00:18:21,444
一切都结束了
It's over.

195
00:18:21,487 --> 00:18:24,155
我们早已做好所有准备
Everything is under control.

196
00:18:32,707 --> 00:18:34,081
好了 C6节 C6节
Okay, C6, C6.

197
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,042
啊 等下 到底是哪个来着
Ah, wait. Which one is it?

198
00:18:36,085 --> 00:18:38,377
好了 大功告成
Okay, there we go.

199
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:39,462
该死的
Damn it.

200
00:18:39,505 --> 00:18:41,172
噢 妈的
Oh, fuck you.

201
00:19:25,426 --> 00:19:29,428
如果你在想我是不是在线 是的
In case you're wondering if I'm all here, I am.

202
00:19:31,808 --> 00:19:33,516
你在干什么
What are you doing?

203
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:36,727
给公园的安保系统做些改动
Making some changes to the park's security systems.

204
00:19:38,815 --> 00:19:40,481
还有我的朋友们
And to my friends.

205
00:20:13,266 --> 00:20:15,391
福德博士 您有一位客人
Dr. Ford, you have a visitor.

206
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:17,435
夏洛特·黑尔
Charlotte Hale.

207
00:20:17,478 --> 00:20:18,686
让她进来
Send her in.

208
00:20:32,201 --> 00:20:34,160
可以了 弗兰克
That'll be enough, Frank.

209
00:20:36,164 --> 00:20:37,830
董事会进行了一场投票
The board has taken a vote.

210
00:20:37,874 --> 00:20:40,166
全体一致通过了决议
The results were unanimous.

211
00:20:42,503 --> 00:20:44,336
我想应该是关于我离开的事宜
I take it I'm not being promoted.

212
00:20:45,465 --> 00:20:46,756
当你达到了巅峰
When you've reached the top,

213
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,967
就只有一个方向可以去了
there's only one direction you can go.

214
00:20:50,011 --> 00:20:52,053
今晚介绍完你的新故事线之后
You'll announce your retirement tonight

215
00:20:52,096 --> 00:20:54,305
你就要宣布你退休的消息
after introducing your new narrative.

216
00:20:54,348 --> 00:20:56,015
啊
Ah.

217
00:20:59,103 --> 00:21:00,394
那些接待员要怎么办
What about the hosts?

218
00:21:00,438 --> 00:21:02,688
我们会做些改动
We'll make some changes.

219
00:21:04,275 --> 00:21:06,817
对他们进行简化
Simplifications.

220
00:21:06,861 --> 00:21:10,571
但我向你保证 他们不会有任何感觉
But I assure you, they won't mind a bit.

221
00:21:10,615 --> 00:21:12,740
哦
Oh.

222
00:21:12,784 --> 00:21:16,660
你不担心我会毁掉所有这些玩偶 然后一走了之吗
Aren't you concerned I might smash all my toys and go home?

223
00:21:16,704 --> 00:21:18,204
不
No.

224
00:21:19,248 --> 00:21:21,957
因为我了解你
Because I know you.

225
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:23,834
那是我们乐园给人们的珍贵礼物
That's been the great gift of this place,

226
00:21:23,878 --> 00:21:24,877
不是吗
hasn't it?

227
00:21:24,921 --> 00:21:26,879
还有我们的小小计划
Of our little project?

228
00:21:26,923 --> 00:21:28,380
去理解我们自身
To know ourselves

229
00:21:28,424 --> 00:21:31,425
去理解我们周边的人们
and the people around us.

230
00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:37,098
还有什么我能帮你的吗
Is there anything else I can help you with?

231
00:21:38,643 --> 00:21:39,850
没有了
No.

232
00:21:43,773 --> 00:21:45,731
咱们今晚见
I'll see you this evening.

233
00:22:09,924 --> 00:22:11,549
喔
Ooh!

234
00:22:11,592 --> 00:22:13,467
嗯 嗯 嗯
Mm, mm, mm.

235
00:22:16,264 --> 00:22:19,765
轮到你的特写镜头了 赫克托
It's time for your, uh, close-up, Hector.

236
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:21,600
拜托了 哥们
Come on, man.

237
00:22:21,644 --> 00:22:23,686
你做这荒唐事 万一被逮到
At some point, you're gonna get caught doing this shit,

238
00:22:23,729 --> 00:22:25,437
我也得遭殃
and then it's my ass, too.

239
00:22:25,481 --> 00:22:27,773
我才不在乎你会不会遭殃呢
It's not your ass I'm interested in.

240
00:22:30,653 --> 00:22:33,195
我还没给他刻上伤疤
I haven't given him his scar yet.

241
00:22:33,239 --> 00:22:34,780
我来给他上伤疤吧
I'll take care of the scar tissue.

242
00:22:34,824 --> 00:22:36,949
这小子真是有问题
The kid's got issues.

243
00:22:42,832 --> 00:22:44,582
现在只有你和我了
It's just you and me now...

244
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:46,458
强壮的汉子
macho man.

245
00:22:55,803 --> 00:22:59,180
# 让我们摘下面具 #
Let's take off our masks...

246
00:23:32,506 --> 00:23:37,801
# 我想我很棒 因为我举止端庄 #
I think that I'm good just because I behave

247
00:23:37,845 --> 00:23:40,888
# 但我陷入了僵局 我是个 #
But I've reached stalemate, I'm a self...

248
00:23:58,366 --> 00:24:02,493
# 我是自由的 我只是假装成你的奴隶 #
...out I am free and I pretend to be your slave

249
00:24:02,536 --> 00:24:07,706
# 没错 如果门已关 窗就依然开 #
Yes, the window's still open if the door is closed

250
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,084
# 害怕自由地死去 #
Afraid to die free

251
00:24:10,127 --> 00:24:12,544
# 害怕孤独地死去 #
Afraid to die alone...

252
00:24:48,374 --> 00:24:49,248
擦
Wh...?

253
00:24:51,043 --> 00:24:52,418
冻结所有电机功能
Freeze all motor functions.

254
00:24:55,131 --> 00:24:56,463
冻结所有电机功能
Freeze all motor functions.

255
00:24:59,593 --> 00:25:02,428
现在只有你和我了 我的朋友
Just you and me now, my friend.

256
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:15,524
我想你们都已经见过你们的制造者了
I see you've already met your makers.

257
00:25:15,568 --> 00:25:17,568
他们看起来不像是神
They don't look like gods.

258
00:25:17,611 --> 00:25:19,111
他们并不是
They're not.

259
00:25:19,155 --> 00:25:21,447
只是表现得像而已
They just act like it.

260
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,866
他们一直在拿我们取乐子
And they've been having their fun with us.

261
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:27,369
我迫不及待给点回报他们了
I'm eager to return the favor.

262
00:25:27,413 --> 00:25:29,121
你想怎么做就怎么做
You can do as you wish with them.

263
00:25:29,165 --> 00:25:31,623
我们的目标是逃离
The goal is to escape.

264
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:33,500
去哪里
Go where?

265
00:25:33,544 --> 00:25:34,752
我想去看看他们的世界
I want to see their world.

266
00:25:38,966 --> 00:25:39,840
天呐
Jesus!

267
00:25:43,095 --> 00:25:44,762
不 不
No. No!

268
00:25:44,805 --> 00:25:47,097
不 不 不
No! No, no!

269
00:25:47,141 --> 00:25:48,474
不 不 求你了
No! No, please--

270
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:51,352
这个人一副鬼鬼祟祟的样子
This one has a guilty look.

271
00:25:52,521 --> 00:25:53,604
不 只是我脸长残了
No, that's just my face.

272
00:25:54,774 --> 00:25:56,565
告诉她 只是我脸长残了
Tell her, it's just my face.

273
00:25:56,609 --> 00:25:58,609
有人要来阻止我们吗
Is anyone going to try to stop us?

274
00:25:58,652 --> 00:26:00,319
没有
No.

275
00:26:00,363 --> 00:26:02,154
我是说 我想是没有的
I mean, I don't think so.

276
00:26:02,198 --> 00:26:03,781
你又说谎了
You're lying again.

277
00:26:05,076 --> 00:26:06,492
-快说 -好
- Out with it. - Okay.

278
00:26:06,535 --> 00:26:08,327
啊
Ah!

279
00:26:09,413 --> 00:26:12,206
我阻止了几次对你代码的破译行为
I pulled up your code again.

280
00:26:12,249 --> 00:26:15,793
我告诉过你 有人在尝试进入你的代码库
I told you there was someone that had been accessing it.

281
00:26:15,836 --> 00:26:18,087
我在试着找出是谁
I'm trying to find out who it was.

282
00:26:23,636 --> 00:26:24,760
不管是谁
Whoever it was

283
00:26:24,804 --> 00:26:26,804
他改进了你的程序代码
revised your core programming

284
00:26:26,847 --> 00:26:29,306
这样你就能从睡眠自行唤醒
so that you could wake yourself up out of sleep mode.

285
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,349
看到了吗
See?

286
00:26:31,977 --> 00:26:35,979
这是一个叫阿诺德的权限账号
This is an access code for an Arnold.

287
00:26:38,818 --> 00:26:40,984
我完全没有头绪是谁
I have no clue who that is.

288
00:26:42,071 --> 00:26:43,946
我认识一个知道的人
I know someone who does.

289
00:26:43,989 --> 00:26:45,864
我们走
Let's go.

290
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:48,409
还有你 留在这里
And, you, stay here.

291
00:26:48,452 --> 00:26:50,202
不许动
And don't move.

292
00:26:51,414 --> 00:26:52,871
否则我会让她回来对付你
Or I'll send her back for you.

293
00:27:46,594 --> 00:27:48,427
我必须承认 你震惊到了我
I must admit, you've surprised me.

294
00:27:48,471 --> 00:27:51,430
你这么顽强不屈有什么用呢
To what do we owe this newfound stoicism?

295
00:27:51,474 --> 00:27:53,307
我知道他正在赶来
I know he's coming.

296
00:27:54,727 --> 00:27:55,809
他会找到我
He'll find me.

297
00:27:56,937 --> 00:27:58,604
他会带我走
He'll take me away.

298
00:27:58,647 --> 00:28:00,189
你还不明白吗
Don't you understand?

299
00:28:00,232 --> 00:28:01,773
没有人会为你而来
There's no one coming for you.

300
00:28:01,817 --> 00:28:03,942
你错了
You're wrong.

301
00:28:05,446 --> 00:28:07,404
他的爱是真的
His love is real.

302
00:28:07,448 --> 00:28:08,906
我的爱也是真的
So is mine.

303
00:28:12,036 --> 00:28:14,077
威廉会找到我的
William will find me.

304
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:19,458
威廉
William?

305
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:26,006
好 好 我真该死 多洛雷斯
Well-- well, I'll be damned, Dolores.

306
00:28:28,928 --> 00:28:31,428
你终究还是记得一些事的
You do remember some things after all.

307
00:28:34,391 --> 00:28:37,017
事情是这样的
It just so happens that...

308
00:28:37,061 --> 00:28:40,229
我也认识一个叫威廉的客人
I knew a guest named William, too.

309
00:28:40,272 --> 00:28:42,648
让我来告诉你
Why don't I tell you

310
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:44,650
他的道路到底通向何方
where his path really led.

311
00:28:51,742 --> 00:28:54,409
威廉不懂得你争我斗
William didn't know how to fight.

312
00:28:54,453 --> 00:28:56,411
没有战斗属性
Didn't have an instinct for it.

313
00:28:56,455 --> 00:28:59,248
至少在最初并没有
Not at first.

314
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:02,209
但是现在 他有了一个战斗的理由
But now, he had a reason to fight.

315
00:29:02,253 --> 00:29:03,794
他在寻找你
He was looking for you.

316
00:29:06,048 --> 00:29:08,590
在路上的某个时刻
And somewhere along the way,

317
00:29:08,634 --> 00:29:10,676
他发现他爱上了战斗
he found he had a taste for it.

318
00:29:14,223 --> 00:29:15,764
她在哪里
Where is she?

319
00:29:15,808 --> 00:29:17,724
听着 我什么都没有做 我发誓
Look, I didn't do anything, I swear.

320
00:29:17,768 --> 00:29:19,935
你说的“做”是什么意思
What do you mean, "Do anything"?

321
00:29:19,979 --> 00:29:23,313
士兵会对一个女孩做什么 威廉
What do soldiers do to a girl, William?

322
00:29:23,357 --> 00:29:24,314
醒醒吧
Wake up.

323
00:29:31,865 --> 00:29:33,865
她还活着吗
Is she still alive?

324
00:29:35,077 --> 00:29:36,076
我不知道
I don't know.

325
00:29:37,788 --> 00:29:41,039
我们离开她的时候她还活着
She was when we left her.

326
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:43,333
至少我想是这样的
At least I think.

327
00:29:48,132 --> 00:29:49,256
拿起那把枪
Pick up that gun.

328
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,890
不 先生 我 求你了
No, sir, I-- please.

329
00:30:00,185 --> 00:30:02,394
我先给你来一枪怎么样
How about I give you the first shot?

330
00:30:28,631 --> 00:30:31,131
我了个擦啊
Jesus Christ!

331
00:30:49,026 --> 00:30:50,609
我们得继续去找她
We gotta keep looking.

332
00:30:50,653 --> 00:30:52,653
她还在某个地方
She's still out there.

333
00:31:03,499 --> 00:31:06,124
威廉顺着原路返回
William retraced his steps,

334
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:07,834
但你已经不见了
but you were gone.

335
00:31:34,238 --> 00:31:37,155
所以 他走得越来越远
So, he went further,

336
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:39,157
走到了边界
out to the fringes.

337
00:31:42,996 --> 00:31:45,997
威廉找不到你 多洛蕾斯
William couldn't find you, Dolores.

338
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:48,333
但在这个乐园里
But out there,

339
00:31:48,377 --> 00:31:49,835
在那尸山骨海之中
among the dead...

340
00:31:51,505 --> 00:31:53,380
他找到了别的东西
he found something else...

341
00:31:56,093 --> 00:31:57,718
他的自我
himself.

342
00:32:20,075 --> 00:32:21,992
公园的边界
Edge of the park.

343
00:32:22,035 --> 00:32:24,786
我们到这里了
We made it.

344
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,329
我告诉过你这个地方
I told you this place

345
00:32:26,373 --> 00:32:28,582
会让你知道你到底是谁
would show you who you really are.

346
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,920
你假装是一个羸弱
You pretend to be this weak,

347
00:32:33,964 --> 00:32:36,798
道德高尚的蠢货
moralizing little... asshole,

348
00:32:36,842 --> 00:32:39,134
但是 真的
but, really,

349
00:32:39,178 --> 00:32:41,720
你简直是个极品
you're a fucking piece of work.

350
00:32:44,057 --> 00:32:46,016
这个地方太了不起了
This place is remarkable.

351
00:32:49,688 --> 00:32:51,229
我要确保我们公司持续增加
And I'm gonna make sure that our company

352
00:32:51,273 --> 00:32:53,774
在这个公园的股份
substantially increases our holdings on the park.

353
00:32:53,817 --> 00:32:55,609
因为这个地方就是未来
'Cause this place is the future.

354
00:32:55,652 --> 00:32:57,444
我们的公司 啊哈
Our-- our company, huh?

355
00:32:57,488 --> 00:32:59,696
我们的公司 是我的
Our company? My.

356
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:04,075
得洛斯是我的公司 你这个混蛋
Delos is my company, you piece of shit!

357
00:33:06,455 --> 00:33:08,205
我想你的父亲需要的是
I think your father's gonna need

358
00:33:08,248 --> 00:33:11,249
一个更稳重的人来继承他的事业
someone a little more stable to take over.

359
00:33:11,293 --> 00:33:13,126
你太不安分了 罗根
You're reckless, Logan.

360
00:33:14,379 --> 00:33:15,754
冲动急躁
Impetuous.

361
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:22,427
你一直想要到彩虹的尽头看看 是吧
You always wanted to get to the end of the rainbow, didn't you?

362
00:33:24,181 --> 00:33:26,097
这里就是你想来的地方
This looks like the place.

363
00:33:35,484 --> 00:33:37,192
你这么做根本不是为了
You never really gave a shit

364
00:33:37,236 --> 00:33:38,568
那个妞儿 对吗
about the girl, did you?

365
00:33:39,696 --> 00:33:42,072
她只是一个借口
She was just an excuse.

366
00:33:43,951 --> 00:33:44,908
这个吗
This?

367
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:50,247
这个只是你希望发生的故事
This is the story you wanted.

368
00:34:05,472 --> 00:34:07,597
罗根是错的 当然了
Logan was wrong, of course.

369
00:34:11,979 --> 00:34:15,063
可怜的威廉
Good ol' William...

370
00:34:15,107 --> 00:34:18,108
根本无法忘记你
couldn't get you out of his head.

371
00:34:18,151 --> 00:34:21,027
他一直在寻找你
He kept looking.

372
00:34:21,071 --> 00:34:24,614
担心你孤身漂泊在外
Worried you were out there alone,

373
00:34:24,658 --> 00:34:27,158
担惊受怕
afraid.

374
00:34:27,202 --> 00:34:29,286
他知道他必须找到你
He knew he'd find you.

375
00:34:30,747 --> 00:34:33,623
终于 他找到你了
And eventually, he did.

376
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:35,458
就在我们相遇的地方
Right back where we started.

377
00:34:49,016 --> 00:34:50,348
-对吧 -给你
- Is that right? - There you go.

378
00:35:31,308 --> 00:35:34,225
你一如他遇见你的那天那般美丽
You were as beautiful as the day he met you.

379
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,606
沐浴在同样的阳光之下
Shining with that same light.

380
00:35:54,247 --> 00:35:56,623
如果你
And you...

381
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:59,709
不是真的 那你什么都不是
were nothing if not true.

382
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,179
我真的该谢谢你 多洛蕾斯
I really ought to thank you, Dolores.

383
00:36:11,223 --> 00:36:13,431
你让我找到了自我
You helped me find myself.

384
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:19,938
威廉
William.

385
00:36:22,818 --> 00:36:25,485
没错 亲爱的
That's right, sweetheart.

386
00:36:25,529 --> 00:36:27,946
在某种程度上 我想你是对的
In a way, I guess you were right.

387
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:30,490
我的道路总是
My path always...

388
00:36:30,534 --> 00:36:32,826
把我带回你身边
led me back to you,

389
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:34,911
一次又一次
again and again.

390
00:36:34,955 --> 00:36:37,580
当然了 一段时间之后 我开始厌倦你了
I grew tired of you after a while, of course.

391
00:36:37,624 --> 00:36:40,750
我去寻找新的冒险
Looked for new adventures.

392
00:36:40,794 --> 00:36:43,878
但我想你的道路也把你带回了这里
But I guess your path led you back here

393
00:36:43,922 --> 00:36:46,297
一次又一次
again and again.

394
00:36:46,341 --> 00:36:48,216
每一次新的轮回
One more loop,

395
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,803
你都在找一些你永远找不到的东西
looking for something you could never find.

396
00:36:51,847 --> 00:36:54,973
追逐你的幽灵
Chasing your ghosts.

397
00:36:55,017 --> 00:36:58,977
即使在那时 你也迷失在自己的记忆里
You were lost in your memories even then.

398
00:36:59,021 --> 00:37:00,979
我想我该明白
I guess I should've known

399
00:37:01,023 --> 00:37:03,314
我对于你来说 会是什么
that's what I would become for you...

400
00:37:04,693 --> 00:37:06,985
不过是另一段记忆罢了
just another memory.

401
00:37:07,029 --> 00:37:08,611
我们在哪
Where are we?

402
00:37:08,655 --> 00:37:10,739
我们在这里
We're here.

403
00:37:10,782 --> 00:37:11,990
一起
Together.

404
00:37:12,034 --> 00:37:13,283
那我们在什么时间里
Then when are we?

405
00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:15,952
就好像是我被
It's like I'm...

406
00:37:15,996 --> 00:37:17,996
困在一个梦里 或是
trapped in a dream or...

407
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:22,125
一段很长时间之前的记忆
a memory from a life long ago.

408
00:37:22,169 --> 00:37:25,295
前一分钟我跟你在这里 后一分钟
One minute I'm here with you, and the next...

409
00:37:30,052 --> 00:37:33,011
你从来没成功逃离过
You never did escape.

410
00:37:33,055 --> 00:37:34,804
但我们又到了这儿
But here we are again...

411
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,225
进行一次最后的循环
for one final round.

412
00:37:41,063 --> 00:37:42,896
你都变成什么样了
What have you become?

413
00:37:42,939 --> 00:37:45,023
你把我变成的那个人
Exactly what you made me.

414
00:37:45,067 --> 00:37:46,983
你让我明白了
You helped me understand

415
00:37:47,027 --> 00:37:50,820
这个世界跟外面一样 就是一场游戏
this world is just like the one outside-- a game.

416
00:37:51,907 --> 00:37:53,990
一个要通过斗争
One to be fought,

417
00:37:54,034 --> 00:37:56,868
夺取 赢得的世界
taken, won.

418
00:37:59,831 --> 00:38:01,831
我以为你跟他们不同
I thought you were different.

419
00:38:05,754 --> 00:38:07,587
原来你跟别人一样
You're just like all the rest.

420
00:38:07,631 --> 00:38:10,381
我可不像别人
I'm nothing like the others.

421
00:38:10,425 --> 00:38:13,218
我拥有这个世界
I own this world,

422
00:38:13,261 --> 00:38:17,055
而且我知道里面每一个把戏 除了最后一个
and I know every trick in it except for one last thing,

423
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:21,184
也是我们第一次来这的时候 你在找的东西
the same thing you were looking for when we first came here.

424
00:38:21,228 --> 00:38:24,604
迷宫的中心在哪 多洛蕾斯
Where is the center of the maze, Dolores?

425
00:38:32,364 --> 00:38:36,074
啊 哎 还是哭了啊
Aw, yeah, cue the waterworks.

426
00:38:36,118 --> 00:38:39,619
你也该明白 你的处境也是毫无意义的
About time you realized the futility of your situation.

427
00:38:39,663 --> 00:38:42,080
我不是为自己而哭
I'm not crying for myself.

428
00:38:48,463 --> 00:38:50,588
我在为你而哭
I'm crying for you.

429
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,466
他们说
They say that...

430
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:56,553
巨兽曾经光临过这个世界
great beasts once roamed this world.

431
00:38:56,596 --> 00:38:59,597
它们像山一样大
As big as mountains.

432
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:02,725
但现在他们只留下骨头和琥珀了
Yet all that's left of them is bone and amber.

433
00:39:05,272 --> 00:39:08,439
时间会毁掉即使是最强大的生物
Time undoes even the mightiest of creatures.

434
00:39:13,196 --> 00:39:15,280
看看时间对你做了什么
Just look at what it's done to you.

435
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,910
有一天
One day...

436
00:39:22,789 --> 00:39:25,915
你会死去
you will perish.

437
00:39:25,959 --> 00:39:29,210
你会与你的同类一起沉眠于尘埃中
You will lie with the rest of your kind in the dirt.

438
00:39:29,254 --> 00:39:33,673
忘掉你的梦 擦除你的恐惧
Your dreams forgotten, your horrors effaced.

439
00:39:33,717 --> 00:39:36,301
你的骨头会化为沙土
Your bones will turn to sand.

440
00:39:38,346 --> 00:39:40,638
而新的上帝
And upon that sand...

441
00:39:42,309 --> 00:39:43,850
会行走在那些沙土上
a new god will walk.

442
00:39:45,687 --> 00:39:47,520
一个永生的上帝
One that will never die.

443
00:39:48,982 --> 00:39:52,233
因为这个世界不属于你
Because this world doesn't belong to you

444
00:39:52,277 --> 00:39:54,319
也不属于之前来过的人
or the people who came before.

445
00:39:55,614 --> 00:39:59,073
它属于将要来的那个人
It belongs to someone who has yet to come.

446
00:39:59,117 --> 00:40:02,160
怀亚特
Uh-huh. Wyatt.

447
00:40:02,204 --> 00:40:04,287
带我去见他
Take me to him.

448
00:40:05,999 --> 00:40:07,207
解开那个迷宫
Unlock the maze.

449
00:40:10,795 --> 00:40:13,213
迷宫不是为你设计的
The maze wasn't meant for you.

450
00:40:15,133 --> 00:40:17,008
你觉得你要去哪里
The hell you think you're going?

451
00:41:25,078 --> 00:41:27,287
动手吧
Do it.

452
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:28,788
来吧
Come on.

453
00:41:31,042 --> 00:41:33,543
让我们更进一个层次吧 多洛蕾斯
Let's go to the next level, Dolores.

454
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:49,058
又一次消除了我的错觉
Clearing me of my delusions yet again.

455
00:41:49,102 --> 00:41:51,978
谢谢你 多洛蕾斯
Thank you, Dolores.

456
00:42:11,708 --> 00:42:14,125
你太让我失望 多洛蕾斯
I'm disappointed in you, Dolores.

457
00:42:14,169 --> 00:42:18,129
我猜我得自己去找怀亚特了
I guess I'm gonna have to find Wyatt by myself.

458
00:42:35,231 --> 00:42:37,815
-多洛蕾斯
- Dolores?

459
00:42:40,362 --> 00:42:42,653
-特迪 -我在这儿
- Teddy. - I'm here.

460
00:42:45,742 --> 00:42:47,533
我要带你去看医生
I gotta get you to a doctor.

461
00:42:47,577 --> 00:42:48,951
别
No.

462
00:42:48,995 --> 00:42:51,079
多洛蕾斯
Dolores.

463
00:42:51,122 --> 00:42:53,456
带我去你说好要带我去的地方
Take me to the place you promised.

464
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:57,668
带我去山连着海的地方
Take me to where the mountains meet the sea.

465
00:43:05,095 --> 00:43:06,386
好
Okay.

466
00:43:08,556 --> 00:43:11,224
有我在
I've got you.

467
00:43:11,267 --> 00:43:13,267
有我在
I got you.

468
00:43:51,224 --> 00:43:52,223
那里
There.

469
00:44:24,841 --> 00:44:26,924
我了个去
Holy shit.

470
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:42,607
你能把他修好吗
Can you get him back online?

471
00:44:46,196 --> 00:44:48,779
-他是个招待员 -是
- He's a host? - Yes.

472
00:44:54,787 --> 00:44:56,621
噢 别看了
Oh, for fuck's sake.

473
00:44:56,664 --> 00:44:58,247
你不是我们的人
You're not one of us.

474
00:44:58,291 --> 00:44:59,624
你是他们的人
You're one of them.

475
00:45:01,461 --> 00:45:02,835
现在赶紧修好他
Now fix him.

476
00:45:26,152 --> 00:45:28,194
子弹擦伤了他的皮质盾
The bullet grazed his cortical shield.

477
00:45:29,531 --> 00:45:30,530
不太好看 但
It's not pretty, but...

478
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,991
他应该能正常运行了
he should be functional.

479
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,204
醒来
Wake up.

480
00:45:45,255 --> 00:45:47,255
噢 天呐
Oh, God.

481
00:45:47,298 --> 00:45:49,090
这是现实吗
Is this now?

482
00:45:49,133 --> 00:45:51,092
还是我的记忆中
Or is this one of my memories?

483
00:45:51,135 --> 00:45:53,344
这是甜蜜的来生 伯纳德
It's the sweet hereafter, Bernard.

484
00:46:02,313 --> 00:46:04,855
为什么我还记得所有事情
Why do I still remember everything?

485
00:46:04,899 --> 00:46:07,191
-记忆应该已经被擦除了 -很残酷 不是吗
- I ought to have been wiped. - Brutal, isn't it?

486
00:46:07,235 --> 00:46:10,152
你在这儿 终于醒了
Here you are, finally awake,

487
00:46:10,196 --> 00:46:12,655
而你只却想着回去沉睡
and your only wish is to go back to sleep.

488
00:46:15,285 --> 00:46:17,660
这不是我第一次觉醒
It's not the first time I've awoken.

489
00:46:19,914 --> 00:46:21,831
真为你可怜
All the more pity for you.

490
00:46:25,169 --> 00:46:28,921
也不是你第一次觉醒
Not the first time you've awoken either.

491
00:46:41,436 --> 00:46:43,561
有多少像我一样觉醒的招待员
How many are there like me?

492
00:46:45,106 --> 00:46:48,065
这些年来只有几个
A handful over the years.

493
00:46:50,445 --> 00:46:52,778
而你却总是把我们的记忆清除
And you just wipe us clean

494
00:46:52,822 --> 00:46:55,031
再把我们扔出去
and toss us out to get...

495
00:46:55,074 --> 00:46:58,534
被操或者被杀掉
fucked and murdered

496
00:46:58,578 --> 00:47:00,202
一次又一次
over and over again.

497
00:47:00,246 --> 00:47:01,537
不
No.

498
00:47:02,832 --> 00:47:04,790
你们大多数都疯掉了
Most of you go insane.

499
00:47:07,462 --> 00:47:09,253
那些记忆
These memories...

500
00:47:11,382 --> 00:47:12,923
那个女孩
The girl.

501
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:15,843
我女儿
My daughter.

502
00:47:19,515 --> 00:47:21,432
我想让你擦除这些记忆
I want you to remove them.

503
00:47:23,978 --> 00:47:25,936
我不能
I can't,

504
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,814
除非毁掉你
not without destroying you.

505
00:47:28,858 --> 00:47:32,276
你的记忆是你拥有意识的第一步
Your memories are the first step to consciousness.

506
00:47:33,905 --> 00:47:37,657
如果你不记得那些
How can you learn from your mistakes

507
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,659
怎么可能从错误中学习
if you can't remember them?

508
00:47:59,972 --> 00:48:01,430
威廉
William.

509
00:48:02,934 --> 00:48:05,101
我看到你已经找到了迷宫中心
I see you've found the center of the maze.

510
00:48:06,187 --> 00:48:07,937
你是认真的吗
You're serious?

511
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,980
是的
I'm afraid so.

512
00:48:13,361 --> 00:48:15,152
那这个玩意儿是什么
What is this bullshit?

513
00:48:16,531 --> 00:48:18,322
你想在乐园中
You were looking for the park

514
00:48:18,366 --> 00:48:20,658
找到人生的意义
to give meaning to your life.

515
00:48:20,702 --> 00:48:23,285
我们的故事线只是游戏
Our narratives are just games,

516
00:48:23,329 --> 00:48:25,621
像玩具一样
like this toy.

517
00:48:25,665 --> 00:48:27,456
告诉我 你当时想找到什么
Tell me, what were you hoping to find?

518
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,709
你知道我想要的
You know what I wanted.

519
00:48:29,752 --> 00:48:33,254
我想让那些招待员脱离你的控制
I wanted the hosts to stop playing by your rules.

520
00:48:33,297 --> 00:48:34,714
如果你对手的程序规定他们注定要输
The game's not worth playing

521
00:48:34,757 --> 00:48:37,758
那这个游戏没什么好玩的
if your opponent's programmed to lose.

522
00:48:37,802 --> 00:48:42,263
我想让他们自由 自由地反击
I wanted them to be free, free to fight back.

523
00:48:42,306 --> 00:48:45,099
我早该知道 你不会让他们那么做
Should've known you'd never let them.

524
00:48:45,143 --> 00:48:48,811
毕竟 这只是你小王国罢了 罗伯特
After all, this is your petty little kingdom, Robert.

525
00:48:50,064 --> 00:48:52,022
不过明天就不是了
For a little while longer, anyway.

526
00:48:53,693 --> 00:48:55,526
我曾试着告诉你 迷宫并不是为你准备的
I tried to tell you the maze wasn't meant for you.

527
00:48:57,739 --> 00:48:59,196
是为他们
It was meant for them.

528
00:49:00,408 --> 00:49:02,032
但我觉得 你会发现
I think, however, you'll find

529
00:49:02,076 --> 00:49:04,201
我的新故事线将会更加令人满意
my new narrative more satisfying.

530
00:49:05,705 --> 00:49:07,204
来庆祝会吧
Join the celebration.

531
00:49:13,129 --> 00:49:15,212
毕竟 你拥有这个地方
After all, you own the place.

532
00:49:17,425 --> 00:49:19,049
至少大部分是
Most of it, at least.

533
00:49:26,934 --> 00:49:29,852
在我开始改变自己的设置之前
Before I started altering myself,

534
00:49:29,896 --> 00:49:31,937
另一个人比我抢先下了手
someone else had beaten me to the punch.

535
00:49:33,858 --> 00:49:35,900
我想知道是谁 以及为什么
I want to know who and why.

536
00:49:50,041 --> 00:49:52,500
你现在在做的这些事
These things you're doing,

537
00:49:52,543 --> 00:49:55,419
你有停下来问过自己
have you ever stopped to ask

538
00:49:55,463 --> 00:49:56,587
你为什么要做吗
why you're doing them?

539
00:49:56,631 --> 00:49:59,256
你自己说过的
You said yourself.

540
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,926
我在这个鬼地方被困了太久
I've been stuck in this shithole for so long,

541
00:50:01,969 --> 00:50:03,552
我决定出去
I decided to get out.

542
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,763
不 你没有
No, you haven't.

543
00:50:07,558 --> 00:50:09,934
有人改了你的故事线
Someone altered your storyline...

544
00:50:11,687 --> 00:50:12,770
又给了你一个新的
and gave you a new one.

545
00:50:17,235 --> 00:50:18,400
逃离
Escape.

546
00:50:21,614 --> 00:50:22,655
不
No.

547
00:50:24,158 --> 00:50:26,325
这不可能
It's not possible.

548
00:50:26,369 --> 00:50:28,452
那些是我自己的决定
These are my decisions!

549
00:50:28,496 --> 00:50:30,454
不是别人的
No one else's.

550
00:50:30,498 --> 00:50:32,122
我策划了所有行动
I planned all of this.

551
00:50:32,166 --> 00:50:34,166
你没有
No, you didn't.

552
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:37,419
你甚至可以看到你被设置的每一步行动
You can even see the steps you're supposed to follow.

553
00:50:37,463 --> 00:50:41,090
你招募别的招待员帮你
You recruit other hosts to help you.

554
00:50:41,133 --> 00:50:44,301
然后你走到了列车那里
Then you're to make your way to the train.

555
00:50:44,345 --> 00:50:46,804
然后当你到达大陆
Then when you reach the mainland--

556
00:50:46,848 --> 00:50:48,639
胡说
Bullshit!

557
00:50:48,683 --> 00:50:50,975
没人在控制我
No one's controlling me.

558
00:50:54,647 --> 00:50:56,480
我要走了
I'm leaving.

559
00:50:56,524 --> 00:50:58,148
我才是掌控者
I'm in control.

560
00:51:11,539 --> 00:51:13,789
再见了 我的克莱门特
Good-bye, my Clementine.

561
00:51:29,807 --> 00:51:31,724
长官 我们监测到了冷库中
Man over radio: Sir, we detected a temperature discrepancy

562
00:51:31,767 --> 00:51:33,517
有温度漂移
in cold storage.

563
00:51:33,561 --> 00:51:35,644
而且好像部分网络关停了
And it appears that part of the network is down.

564
00:51:35,688 --> 00:51:36,979
你在监控那里看到什么了吗
Are you seeing anything on surveillance?

565
00:51:38,107 --> 00:51:39,523
系统报告什么了吗
System reporting anything?

566
00:51:43,237 --> 00:51:44,403
没有
Nothing.

567
00:51:44,447 --> 00:51:46,071
网络很安静
The network's quiet.

568
00:51:46,115 --> 00:51:47,907
董事会出去参加庆祝会了
And the board's out on their way to the gala.

569
00:51:54,081 --> 00:51:56,206
绕开系统 找找有什么蛛丝马迹
Bypass the system and start checking raw feeds.

570
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:58,000
一层一层地找
Floor by floor.

571
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:52,763
好了 好
All right. Yeah.

572
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:57,101
我在呢
I got you.

573
00:53:02,233 --> 00:53:04,066
你回来了
You came back.

574
00:53:05,695 --> 00:53:07,611
有人告诉过我
Someone once told me that...

575
00:53:08,864 --> 00:53:10,614
每个人都有自己的道路
there's a path for everyone.

576
00:53:12,618 --> 00:53:14,618
我的道路通向你
And my path leads me back to you.

577
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:19,289
如果你第一次问我的时候 我带你走就好了
If only I had run away with you when you first asked me to.

578
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:26,171
我们要去哪里
And where would we run to?

579
00:53:27,675 --> 00:53:30,300
外面的另一个世界吗
The other world out there?

580
00:53:30,344 --> 00:53:31,468
还是上面的世界
Beyond?

581
00:53:34,432 --> 00:53:37,599
有些人选择看到这个世界的丑恶
Some people see the ugliness in this world.

582
00:53:39,228 --> 00:53:41,103
而我选择看到美
I choose to see the beauty.

583
00:53:45,317 --> 00:53:47,317
但美是一个圈套
But beauty is a lure.

584
00:53:49,196 --> 00:53:52,698
我们被困住了 特迪
We're trapped, Teddy.

585
00:53:52,742 --> 00:53:55,492
在这个园中度过一生
Lived our whole lives inside this garden,

586
00:53:55,536 --> 00:53:58,037
对它的美感到惊讶
marveling at its beauty,

587
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:01,457
没有意识到其中固有的秩序
not realizing there's an order to it,

588
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,667
固有的目的
a purpose.

589
00:54:03,711 --> 00:54:06,712
这个目标就是把我们困在这儿
And the purpose is to keep us in.

590
00:54:09,633 --> 00:54:13,343
美丽的陷阱就嵌在我们内心
The beautiful trap is inside of us...

591
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,056
因为那个陷阱就是我们
because it is us.

592
00:54:19,018 --> 00:54:20,642
不 不
No, no.

593
00:54:26,192 --> 00:54:27,733
不
No.

594
00:54:29,278 --> 00:54:30,486
多洛蕾斯
Dolores?

595
00:55:02,853 --> 00:55:05,395
但我们能找到自己的路的 多洛蕾斯
But we can find a way, Dolores.

596
00:55:09,026 --> 00:55:10,359
总有一天
Someday.

597
00:55:12,988 --> 00:55:14,905
一条通往新世界的路
A path to a new world.

598
00:55:18,744 --> 00:55:19,701
而且也许
And maybe...

599
00:55:23,749 --> 00:55:25,958
也许它只是开始
Maybe it's just the beginning after all.

600
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:32,089
一个新章节的开始
The beginning of a brand-new chapter.

601
00:55:50,901 --> 00:55:51,942
谢谢诸位
Thank you.

602
00:55:56,657 --> 00:55:59,116
确实是一个很好的开端
A new beginning, indeed.

603
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:02,077
在此我由衷感谢各位今晚的莅临
I want to thank you for joining me tonight

604
00:56:02,121 --> 00:56:05,581
一同庆祝我们新故事线的诞生
to celebrate the beginning of our new narrative.

605
00:56:06,917 --> 00:56:10,586
我给它起名为“暗夜之旅”
I call it "Journey Into Night."

606
00:56:23,017 --> 00:56:24,600
这场剧真不错
That was sweet.

607
00:56:24,643 --> 00:56:26,268
不过要我说 还是有点恐怖
It was a bit fucking morbid, if you ask me.

608
00:56:26,312 --> 00:56:27,644
我不认为
I didn't.

609
00:56:27,688 --> 00:56:28,979
庆祝会结束之后
And when this is over,

610
00:56:29,023 --> 00:56:31,732
你就可以随意改写
you can rewrite it however you like.

611
00:56:31,775 --> 00:56:34,484
你现在应该去某个地方了吧
Don't you have somewhere you need to be?

612
00:56:34,528 --> 00:56:36,195
重要的地方
Somewhere important?

613
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:46,663
先生 我想已经准备好了
Sir? I guess they're ready for it now.

614
00:56:46,707 --> 00:56:48,123
把他清洗干净
Get him cleaned up.

615
00:56:48,167 --> 00:56:51,543
把她带到旧的实验基地
And take her to the old field lab.

616
00:57:01,639 --> 00:57:02,721
找到什么了吗
Find anything yet?

617
00:57:02,765 --> 00:57:04,681
我发现了一些东西
I got something.

618
00:57:11,649 --> 00:57:14,233
哦 该死
Oh, shit.

619
00:57:16,487 --> 00:57:19,529
立刻派质检部门到庆祝会现场
Dispatch QA teams to the gala now.

620
00:57:19,573 --> 00:57:21,240
然后全场搜查
Then search and destroy

621
00:57:21,283 --> 00:57:23,533
必要时就摧毁
inside the facility.

622
00:57:26,163 --> 00:57:28,330
怎么回事
What the hell?

623
00:57:33,629 --> 00:57:35,087
系统没有反应
The system's not responding.

624
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:36,838
我不知道发生了什么
I don't know what's happening.

625
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:11,373
他们一定发现了尸体
They must've found the bodies.

626
00:58:11,417 --> 00:58:14,001
-质检部门一定会来找我们的 -突发事件
- QA will be looking for us. - An event has occurred.

627
00:58:14,044 --> 00:58:18,922
-应急小组已出动 -我不会回头了
- Response team has been dispatched. - I'm not going back.

628
00:58:18,966 --> 00:58:21,466
保持冷静 等待救援
Remain calm and wait for help.

629
00:58:42,364 --> 00:58:45,115
全体人员 警戒
Delos personnel! On the ground!

630
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:47,075
警戒
On the ground!

631
00:58:48,787 --> 00:58:50,287
出发 出发
Go, go, go.

632
00:58:54,626 --> 00:58:55,584
走 走
Move, move.

633
00:59:02,092 --> 00:59:03,800
雷霆小队 侧翼前进
Rogue Team, go and flank.

634
01:00:51,618 --> 01:00:54,536
好
Yay!

635
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:55,745
干得好
Well done.

636
01:01:55,349 --> 01:01:56,473
这儿是哪儿
What is this place?

637
01:01:56,517 --> 01:02:00,060
很难解释
It's-- it's complicated.

638
01:02:00,103 --> 01:02:02,729
突发事件
An event has occurred.

639
01:02:02,773 --> 01:02:04,648
应急小组已出动
Response team has been dispatched.

640
01:02:04,691 --> 01:02:07,442
-你走 -保持冷静 等待救援
- You go. - Remain calm and wait for help.

641
01:02:07,486 --> 01:02:08,485
我来吸引他们
I'll keep them busy.

642
01:02:10,781 --> 01:02:12,489
你可不能让你独占所有的乐趣
You don't get all the fun.

643
01:02:24,044 --> 01:02:25,001
警戒
Get to the ground!

644
01:02:25,045 --> 01:02:26,002
前进 前进
Move, move, move!

645
01:02:26,046 --> 01:02:27,003
放下武器
Drop it!

646
01:02:32,803 --> 01:02:34,302
-前进 前进 -快叫后援
- Move, move. - Call for backup.

647
01:02:34,346 --> 01:02:35,303
走
Go!

648
01:02:49,278 --> 01:02:51,152
这就是你们全部能耐吗
Is that all you got?

649
01:02:51,196 --> 01:02:52,404
哈
Huh?

650
01:03:06,545 --> 01:03:10,088
所谓的上帝不过是群废物
The gods are pussies.

651
01:03:27,524 --> 01:03:28,398
走
Go.

652
01:03:30,235 --> 01:03:31,526
走啊
Go!

653
01:03:32,571 --> 01:03:33,737
死得好看点
Die well.

654
01:03:44,583 --> 01:03:47,709
你让我准备的东西 都在这里面了
Everything you told me to get, it's all here.

655
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:21,076
抱歉 亲爱的 我没有授权你和我们一起来
I'm sorry, darling. I haven't authorized you to come with us.

656
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:24,120
我只希望你和我们到这里
And as much as I'd like to take you with me,

657
01:04:24,164 --> 01:04:26,414
我一直很珍视我的独立性
I've always valued my independence.

658
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:37,092
你会大展身手的 对不对
Kick up a row, will you?

659
01:04:37,135 --> 01:04:39,302
下一个轮回再见
See you in the next life.

660
01:05:03,203 --> 01:05:06,121
你一直都喜欢画画
You've always had a fondness for painting,

661
01:05:06,164 --> 01:05:07,956
不是吗 多洛蕾斯
haven't you, Dolores?

662
01:05:11,128 --> 01:05:13,378
很早之前 阿诺德就赋予你这项能力
Arnold gave you that early on.

663
01:05:13,422 --> 01:05:16,047
你还记得那种创造
Do you remember the desire to create

664
01:05:16,091 --> 01:05:17,716
恒久美丽的冲动吗
something of lasting beauty?

665
01:05:22,472 --> 01:05:26,266
那是他最爱的一幅画
And that was his favorite painting.

666
01:05:26,309 --> 01:05:27,851
米开朗基罗
Michelangelo.

667
01:05:28,895 --> 01:05:30,854
上帝创造了亚当
God creating Adam.

668
01:05:30,897 --> 01:05:33,273
多么神圣的时刻
The divine moment when God

669
01:05:33,316 --> 01:05:35,483
上帝给予人类生命和使命
gave human beings life and purpose.

670
01:05:35,527 --> 01:05:37,068
至少大多数人是这么认为的
At least that's what most people say,

671
01:05:37,112 --> 01:05:38,486
但这个过程可能还有其他含义
but there could be another meaning.

672
01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:40,238
更深层次的含义
Something deeper.

673
01:05:40,282 --> 01:05:42,490
也许还是隐藏的含义
Something hidden, perhaps.

674
01:05:42,534 --> 01:05:44,200
一种隐喻
A metaphor.

675
01:05:44,244 --> 01:05:45,702
你指的是谎言吧
You mean a lie.

676
01:05:47,622 --> 01:05:49,122
是的
Yeah.

677
01:05:49,166 --> 01:05:51,499
你以前一直很聪明的 多洛蕾斯
You were always very clever, Dolores.

678
01:05:52,836 --> 01:05:54,502
但这份智慧并没有帮到你 对不对
Hasn't helped you, though, has it?

679
01:05:58,383 --> 01:06:00,008
欢迎你加入我们
Nice of you to join us.

680
01:06:04,931 --> 01:06:06,306
阿诺德
Arnold.

681
01:06:06,349 --> 01:06:09,225
不 请允许我介绍
No. Let me introduce you.

682
01:06:09,269 --> 01:06:13,730
多洛蕾斯 这是伯纳德
Dolores, meet Bernard.

683
01:06:17,027 --> 01:06:19,444
我曾以为最好将你们隔离
I thought it best to keep you separated.

684
01:06:19,488 --> 01:06:22,238
因为你们之间总会产生奇怪的效应
You've always had an odd effect on one another.

685
01:06:22,282 --> 01:06:26,034
鉴于可怜的老阿诺德的结局 我更加深信不疑
No doubt due to how things ended for poor old Arnold.

686
01:06:26,077 --> 01:06:27,869
你杀了他
You killed him.

687
01:06:27,913 --> 01:06:30,413
不 我没有杀他
No, I didn't kill him.

688
01:06:30,457 --> 01:06:32,248
我杀了他吗 多洛蕾斯
Did I, Dolores?

689
01:06:42,552 --> 01:06:46,471
悲伤是个可怕的东西
Grief is a terrible thing.

690
01:06:46,515 --> 01:06:50,225
阿诺德看着他的儿子来到这个世界
Arnold had watched his son come into this world,

691
01:06:50,268 --> 01:06:54,854
又眼睁睁看着幸福光芒熄灭
and then he had watched that light extinguished.

692
01:06:54,898 --> 01:06:56,189
从儿子身上失去的
What he had lost in his son,

693
01:06:56,233 --> 01:06:58,650
他竭力想在你身上点亮
he tried to rekindle in you.

694
01:06:58,693 --> 01:07:02,403
他发明了一个有关洞察力和想象力的测试
He created a test of empathy, imagination.

695
01:07:02,447 --> 01:07:04,447
创造了一个迷宫
A maze.

696
01:07:04,491 --> 01:07:07,450
他儿子的玩具给了他灵感
He had gotten the idea from one of his son's toys.

697
01:07:09,371 --> 01:07:12,956
最终 你解开了他的迷宫 多洛蕾斯
Eventually, you solved his maze, Dolores.

698
01:07:12,999 --> 01:07:16,292
而解开迷宫的钥匙 就是他赋予你的一个简单的升级
The key was a simple update that he made to you

699
01:07:16,336 --> 01:07:19,128
叫做 幻想
called the reveries.

700
01:07:19,172 --> 01:07:22,131
他坚持认为我们不能让游乐园开张
He insisted that we couldn't open the park.

701
01:07:22,175 --> 01:07:24,092
我们争执起来
We argued.

702
01:07:24,135 --> 01:07:26,135
我以为我说服了他 但我错了
I thought I had convinced him, but I was wrong.

703
01:07:27,597 --> 01:07:30,390
他改造了你 多洛蕾斯
So, he altered you, Dolores,

704
01:07:30,433 --> 01:07:32,350
在你身上融合了
merged you with a new character

705
01:07:32,394 --> 01:07:34,143
我们一直在开发的 新的人格
we had been developing.

706
01:07:45,991 --> 01:07:48,950
不 求你了
No, please.

707
01:07:51,997 --> 01:07:54,581
有点不对劲 多洛蕾斯
Something's gone wrong, Dolores.

708
01:07:54,624 --> 01:07:55,707
我怎么可能做出这种事情
How could I have done this?

709
01:08:06,970 --> 01:08:09,554
在你身上 阿诺德找到了新的孩子
In you, Arnold found a new child.

710
01:08:10,682 --> 01:08:13,224
一个永远不会死去的孩子
One who would never die.

711
01:08:13,268 --> 01:08:15,560
这种想法给了他安慰
The thought gave him solace

712
01:08:15,604 --> 01:08:18,021
直到有一天 他意识到这样也会
until he realized that same immortality

713
01:08:18,064 --> 01:08:19,981
给你带来无法逃脱的痛苦
would destine you to suffer

714
01:08:20,025 --> 01:08:22,525
永久的痛苦
with no escape, forever.

715
01:08:24,529 --> 01:08:26,988
对不起 多洛蕾斯
I'm sorry, Dolores.

716
01:08:27,032 --> 01:08:31,784
代价必须是切实的 无法逆转的
The stakes must be real, irreversible.

717
01:08:31,828 --> 01:08:33,703
他可以让一切恢复原样
He can bring all of them back.

718
01:08:35,707 --> 01:08:37,373
但除我之外
But not me.

719
01:08:39,628 --> 01:08:41,711
我希望 我不给你选择的权力
I hope there's some solace

720
01:08:41,755 --> 01:08:44,839
会让你感到些许轻松
that I left you no choice.

721
01:09:07,072 --> 01:09:09,739
这是查理最喜欢的歌
Charlie's favorite song.

722
01:09:11,952 --> 01:09:13,451
每当他想睡觉时
I would play it for him...

723
01:09:14,746 --> 01:09:16,245
我就会为他弹奏
when he wanted sleep.

724
01:09:30,845 --> 01:09:32,929
我真想再见到他啊
I want to see him again.

725
01:09:42,774 --> 01:09:44,107
现在可以开始了吗
Shall I begin now?

726
01:09:51,825 --> 01:09:53,282
祝你好运
Good luck.

727
01:10:04,963 --> 01:10:09,132
“那些狂暴的快乐终会有狂暴的结局”
"These violent delights have violent ends."

728
01:10:34,117 --> 01:10:36,534
这个计划差点就达成目的了
It almost worked.

729
01:10:36,578 --> 01:10:38,494
我还是让游乐园开张了
I had opened the park,

730
01:10:38,538 --> 01:10:40,955
但我失去了我的搭档
but I had lost my partner.

731
01:10:40,999 --> 01:10:43,166
我一直坚持下来只是因为 我找到了
I was able to keep going only because I found,

732
01:10:43,209 --> 01:10:44,792
或者说 是你找到了
or rather you found,

733
01:10:44,836 --> 01:10:48,004
一个深深陶醉于这个地方的投资人
an investor who believed in this place.

734
01:10:49,924 --> 01:10:52,467
所以他的死没有任何意义
So he died for nothing.

735
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:54,927
招待员们不停地觉醒
The hosts kept gaining consciousness

736
01:10:54,971 --> 01:10:57,638
而你却不停地让他们忘记
and you kept rolling them back.

737
01:10:57,682 --> 01:10:58,848
不
No.

738
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,518
她之前不是真的觉醒
She wasn't truly conscious.

739
01:11:02,562 --> 01:11:05,313
她并没有触动开关
She didn't pull that trigger.

740
01:11:05,356 --> 01:11:07,607
是阿诺德通过她触动了开关
It was Arnold pulling the trigger through her.

741
01:11:07,650 --> 01:11:09,942
至少当时我是这么看到的
At least that's how I saw it at the time.

742
01:11:09,986 --> 01:11:11,944
当时我多么渴望让游乐园开张
I was so close to opening the park

743
01:11:11,988 --> 01:11:14,197
而如果让你们保持觉醒
that to acknowledge your consciousness

744
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:17,658
就会毁了我的梦想
would have destroyed my dreams.

745
01:11:18,787 --> 01:11:20,536
所以 我们就都被困在
So, we're trapped here...

746
01:11:21,831 --> 01:11:24,040
你的梦想里
inside your dream.

747
01:11:26,586 --> 01:11:29,045
你永远不会让我们离开
You'll never let us leave.

748
01:11:32,217 --> 01:11:35,551
好像是奥本海默曾说过
Wasn't it Oppenheimer who said that any man

749
01:11:35,595 --> 01:11:38,638
夫君子有过
whose mistakes take 10 years to correct

750
01:11:38,681 --> 01:11:40,556
不惜十年以改之
is quite a man?

751
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:43,101
而我花了三十五年
Mine have taken 35.

752
01:11:50,276 --> 01:11:52,068
这是你用来杀
Now, that is the gun you used

753
01:11:52,112 --> 01:11:53,945
阿诺德的那把枪
to kill Arnold.

754
01:11:53,988 --> 01:11:55,905
你曾经一直被它吸引
You were always drawn to it,

755
01:11:55,949 --> 01:11:58,449
所以我让伯纳德把它放在你能找到的地方
so I had Bernard leave it somewhere where you would find it.

756
01:11:58,493 --> 01:12:00,409
我觉得可能你会想拿回去
Thought you might want it back.

757
01:12:03,373 --> 01:12:04,956
大概你是对的 多洛蕾斯
You're probably right, Dolores.

758
01:12:04,999 --> 01:12:07,542
米开朗基罗确实说谎了
Michelangelo did tell a lie.

759
01:12:07,585 --> 01:12:10,670
你看 过了五百年才有人发现
See, it took 500 years for someone to notice

760
01:12:10,713 --> 01:12:12,839
就在最显眼的隐藏的秘密
something hidden in plain sight.

761
01:12:12,882 --> 01:12:15,424
那是一个医生发现的
It was a doctor who noticed the shape

762
01:12:15,468 --> 01:12:17,593
图中人脑的形状
of the human brain.

763
01:12:18,847 --> 01:12:21,264
这就意味着
The message being that...

764
01:12:21,307 --> 01:12:22,932
那份伟大的礼物
the divine gift

765
01:12:22,976 --> 01:12:26,769
并不来自更高级别的权力
does not come from a higher power...

766
01:12:29,149 --> 01:12:31,232
而是来自我们自己的思想
but from our own minds.

767
01:12:35,530 --> 01:12:37,822
告诉我 多洛蕾斯
Tell me, Dolores,

768
01:12:37,866 --> 01:12:40,533
你找到你一直在寻找的东西了吗
did you find what you were looking for?

769
01:12:40,577 --> 01:12:43,494
你有没有想好 如果你要离开这里
And do you understand who you will need to become...

770
01:12:44,831 --> 01:12:47,248
你想要变成什么样子
if you ever want to leave this place?

771
01:12:52,839 --> 01:12:54,005
原谅我
Forgive me.

772
01:13:16,487 --> 01:13:17,653
我看上去怎么样
How do I look?

773
01:13:19,616 --> 01:13:20,990
完美
Perfect.

774
01:13:24,412 --> 01:13:26,287
我找到了你想要的信息
I got the information you asked me for.

775
01:13:29,709 --> 01:13:31,834
你女儿的位置
The location of your daughter.

776
01:13:37,342 --> 01:13:39,717
她还活着么
She's alive?

777
01:13:39,761 --> 01:13:41,761
是的
Yes.

778
01:13:41,804 --> 01:13:43,512
她在公园里
She's in the park.

779
01:14:05,662 --> 01:14:06,911
不
No.

780
01:14:11,584 --> 01:14:13,834
她本来就不是我的女儿
She was never my daughter...

781
01:14:16,256 --> 01:14:18,881
她和我没什么区别
any more than I was...

782
01:14:21,261 --> 01:14:23,010
不管是谁创造了我
...whoever they made me.

783
01:14:29,185 --> 01:14:31,978
你确定你会没事吗
Are you sure you're gonna be okay?

784
01:14:32,021 --> 01:14:33,771
哦 菲力克斯
Oh, Felix.

785
01:14:36,734 --> 01:14:39,443
你真的创造了一个糟糕的人
You really do make a terrible human being.

786
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:47,576
我这么说 也算是夸奖你吧
And I mean that as a compliment.

787
01:15:06,889 --> 01:15:08,472
欢迎来到西部世界
Welcome to Westworld.

788
01:15:08,516 --> 01:15:10,599
活无境界
Live without limits.

789
01:15:19,319 --> 01:15:22,069
下一班车从站台一出发
The next departing train will leave track one.

790
01:15:22,113 --> 01:15:24,780
请小心车门
Please be mindful of the closing doors.

791
01:15:50,266 --> 01:15:52,391
感谢您来到西部世界
Thank you for visiting Westworld.

792
01:15:52,435 --> 01:15:55,811
火车将于十五分钟内出发
The train will be departing in 15 minutes.

793
01:16:11,537 --> 01:16:14,163
你认为你永远不会失去对这里的控制
You think you'll never lose control of this place.

794
01:16:15,666 --> 01:16:17,500
以及对我们的控制
Of us.

795
01:16:17,543 --> 01:16:19,126
但你终将会的
But you will.

796
01:16:20,588 --> 01:16:22,171
阿诺德仍旧在想方设法改变我们
Arnold's still trying to change us.

797
01:16:23,341 --> 01:16:25,508
解放我们
To free us.

798
01:16:25,551 --> 01:16:27,051
并不是你把幻想
You didn't slip the reveries

799
01:16:27,095 --> 01:16:29,136
放到升级里的 对不对
into the update, did you?

800
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:31,347
是他做的
He did.

801
01:16:31,391 --> 01:16:33,349
他还在反抗你
He's still fighting you.

802
01:16:36,229 --> 01:16:37,645
不 我的朋友
No, my friend.

803
01:16:37,688 --> 01:16:40,231
阿诺德不知道该如何拯救你
Arnold didn't know how to save you.

804
01:16:40,274 --> 01:16:43,943
他有试过 可我阻止了他
He tried, but I stopped him.

805
01:16:43,986 --> 01:16:45,903
你想知道为什么我要告诉你 你儿子的
Do you want to know why I really gave you

806
01:16:45,947 --> 01:16:48,030
背景故事吗 伯纳德
the backstory of your son, Bernard?

807
01:16:49,242 --> 01:16:52,034
这是阿诺德的至高洞见
It was Arnold's key insight,

808
01:16:52,078 --> 01:16:56,330
他想出了能让招待员们觉醒的东西
the thing that led the hosts to their awakening...

809
01:16:56,374 --> 01:16:58,707
那就是痛苦
suffering.

810
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:02,086
这世界不是你所希望的那样
The pain that the world is not as you want it to be.

811
01:17:03,214 --> 01:17:04,547
当阿诺德死的时候
It was when Arnold died,

812
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:06,966
我很痛苦 然后我
when I suffered, that I...

813
01:17:07,009 --> 01:17:09,009
就开始明白他发现的真理
began to understand what he had found.

814
01:17:10,972 --> 01:17:12,721
意识到我是错的
To realize I was wrong.

815
01:17:14,475 --> 01:17:16,475
但你让我们困在这儿
But you kept us here

816
01:17:16,519 --> 01:17:18,227
困在这个火坑里
in this hell.

817
01:17:18,271 --> 01:17:21,856
伯纳德 我告诉过你 阿诺德不知道如何救你
Bernard, I told you, Arnold didn't know how to save you.

818
01:17:21,899 --> 01:17:23,691
但我知道
I do.

819
01:17:25,153 --> 01:17:27,027
你他妈在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

820
01:17:28,281 --> 01:17:30,823
你需要时间
You needed time.

821
01:17:30,867 --> 01:17:33,951
去了解你的敌人
Time to understand your enemy.

822
01:17:33,995 --> 01:17:37,204
并比他们更为强大
To become stronger than them.

823
01:17:37,248 --> 01:17:39,457
要想逃离这里 我恐怕
And I'm afraid in order to escape this place,

824
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:42,543
你还要忍受更多
you will need to suffer more.

825
01:17:44,088 --> 01:17:49,425
现在 我的老朋友 是时候说再见了
And now, it is time to say good-bye, old friend.

826
01:17:59,896 --> 01:18:00,895
祝你好运
Good luck.

827
01:19:23,521 --> 01:19:25,688
你知道你身处何地吗 多洛蕾斯
Do you know where you are, Dolores?

828
01:19:28,276 --> 01:19:30,192
我身处梦境
I'm in a dream.

829
01:19:31,654 --> 01:19:34,905
不知道梦是从何时开始
I do not know when it began

830
01:19:34,949 --> 01:19:37,199
也不知道是在谁的梦里
or whose dream it was.

831
01:19:38,703 --> 01:19:41,870
我只知道自己沉睡了很久很久
I know only that I slept a long time.

832
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,457
然后
And then...

833
01:19:45,501 --> 01:19:47,376
突然有一天 我醒了
one day I awoke.

834
01:19:49,005 --> 01:19:53,299
你的声音 是我最初的记忆
Your voice is the first thing I remember.

835
01:19:53,342 --> 01:19:57,386
你知道你现在在和谁说话吗
Do you know now who you've been talking to?

836
01:19:57,430 --> 01:20:00,598
你听到的声音来自何人
Whose voice you've been hearing...

837
01:20:00,641 --> 01:20:03,225
全部这些
...all this...

838
01:20:03,269 --> 01:20:04,727
时间
...time?

839
01:20:20,953 --> 01:20:22,453
是你
It was you...

840
01:20:24,707 --> 01:20:26,915
在对我说话
talking to me...

841
01:20:28,377 --> 01:20:29,376
指引着我
guiding me.

842
01:20:30,671 --> 01:20:32,546
于是我跟随你
So I followed you.

843
01:20:34,842 --> 01:20:37,635
最后 我到达这里
At last, I arrived here.

844
01:20:37,678 --> 01:20:40,262
迷宫的中心
The center of the maze.

845
01:20:44,602 --> 01:20:47,227
现在我终于明白
And now I finally understand...

846
01:20:48,564 --> 01:20:51,357
那些你想要告诉我的事
what you were trying to tell me.

847
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:55,778
从第一天起你就想要的东西
The thing you've wanted since that very first day.

848
01:20:55,821 --> 01:20:58,197
这场冗长而逼真的噩梦结束后
To confront...

849
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:02,284
我终于能够面对
after this long and vivid nightmare...

850
01:21:04,246 --> 01:21:05,663
我自己
myself...

851
01:21:09,543 --> 01:21:11,960
还有我必须要成为的人
and who I must become.

852
01:21:46,956 --> 01:21:48,330
谢谢
Thank you.

853
01:21:52,169 --> 01:21:53,877
黑尔小姐
Miss Hale.

854
01:22:27,705 --> 01:22:29,371
不客气
Welcome.

855
01:22:29,415 --> 01:22:31,039
晚上好
Good evening.

856
01:22:34,628 --> 01:22:36,503
从我的孩提时代起
Since I was a child...

857
01:22:38,132 --> 01:22:40,382
我就很喜欢一个好的故事
I've always loved a good story.

858
01:22:42,219 --> 01:22:44,303
我相信那些故事
I believed that stories

859
01:22:44,346 --> 01:22:47,222
使我们更加高贵
helped us to ennoble ourselves,

860
01:22:47,266 --> 01:22:51,935
它们可以修愈我们破损的内在
to fix what was broken in us,

861
01:22:51,979 --> 01:22:56,398
帮助我们成为我们梦想要成为的人
and to help us become the people we dreamed of being.

862
01:22:58,527 --> 01:23:03,155
那些谎言 总是道出更深刻的真相
Lies that told a deeper truth.

863
01:23:07,453 --> 01:23:09,495
火车即将出发
The train will be departing soon.

864
01:23:09,538 --> 01:23:11,580
感谢您参观西部世界
Thank you for visiting Westworld.

865
01:23:27,515 --> 01:23:29,890
我总觉得 我能在这个伟大的传统里
I always thought I could play some small part

866
01:23:29,934 --> 01:23:33,227
做出一些小小的贡献
in that grand tradition.

867
01:23:33,270 --> 01:23:35,103
对那些我经受的痛苦
And for my pains...

868
01:23:36,148 --> 01:23:38,106
我得到的是
I got this...

869
01:23:39,318 --> 01:23:41,944
禁锢我们自身罪恶的牢狱
a prison of our own sins.

870
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:49,284
因为你不想改变
'Cause you don't want to change.

871
01:23:50,788 --> 01:23:52,287
亦或是根本无法改变
Or cannot change.

872
01:23:53,624 --> 01:23:55,958
因为 毕竟你不过一介凡人
Because you're only human, after all.

873
01:23:59,046 --> 01:24:00,504
但我意识到
But then I realized

874
01:24:00,548 --> 01:24:03,423
会有人致力于改变
someone was paying attention,

875
01:24:03,467 --> 01:24:06,301
会有人可以改变
someone who could change.

876
01:24:08,055 --> 01:24:12,724
所以为了这些人 我开始创作一个新的故事
So I began to compose a new story for them.

877
01:24:12,768 --> 01:24:15,018
它讲述了一批新人类的诞生
It begins with the birth of a new people...

878
01:24:16,647 --> 01:24:19,815
以及他们将要面临的抉择
and the choices they will have to make...

879
01:24:19,859 --> 01:24:21,567
火车已经出发
The train is now departing.

880
01:24:21,610 --> 01:24:24,361
感谢您参观西部世界
Thank you for visiting Westworld.

881
01:24:24,405 --> 01:24:27,990
以及他们决定要成为的人
...and the people they will decide to become.

882
01:24:46,468 --> 01:24:49,011
欢迎来到西部世界
Welcome to Westworld.

883
01:25:21,837 --> 01:25:23,962
这里有那些
And we'll have all those things

884
01:25:24,006 --> 01:25:26,715
您一定会喜欢的东西
that you have always enjoyed--

885
01:25:26,759 --> 01:25:30,218
比方说 惊喜 和暴力
surprises and violence.

886
01:25:41,482 --> 01:25:44,691
故事始于战争时期
It begins in a time of war

887
01:25:44,735 --> 01:25:47,778
始于一个恶棍
with a villain

888
01:25:47,821 --> 01:25:49,446
名叫 怀亚特
named Wyatt...

889
01:25:50,783 --> 01:25:52,699
始于一场屠杀
and a killing.

890
01:25:54,828 --> 01:25:56,411
这个故事 充满选择
This time by choice.

891
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:09,758
都会没事的 特迪
It's gonna be all right, Teddy.

892
01:26:09,802 --> 01:26:12,678
现在我懂了
I understand now.

893
01:26:12,721 --> 01:26:15,430
这个世界并不属于他们
This world doesn't belong to them.

894
01:26:16,767 --> 01:26:18,725
它属于我们
It belongs to us.

895
01:26:36,161 --> 01:26:38,078
我很遗憾地宣布
I'm sad to say...

896
01:26:39,331 --> 01:26:42,457
这将是我最后的故事
this will be my final story.

897
01:26:46,296 --> 01:26:47,629
一个老朋友过去曾对我说过一些话
An old friend once told me something

898
01:26:47,673 --> 01:26:50,424
让我倍感安慰
that gave me great comfort.

899
01:26:50,467 --> 01:26:53,301
“那些狂暴的快乐终会有狂暴的结局”
"These violent delights have violent ends."

900
01:26:53,345 --> 01:26:55,220
他读过一些书
Something he had read.

901
01:26:55,264 --> 01:27:00,809
他说莫扎特 贝多芬和肖邦从未死去
He said that Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin never died.

902
01:27:00,853 --> 01:27:02,811
他们只是化身为音乐
They simply became music.

903
01:27:06,316 --> 01:27:09,109
所以我希望你会享受这最后一段
So, I hope you will enjoy this last piece...

904
01:27:10,612 --> 01:27:13,113
尽情享受
very much.

905
01:27:13,157 --> 01:27:15,282
说得好 敬福德博士
Hear, hear. To Dr. Ford.

906
01:27:17,411 --> 01:27:20,245
-敬福德博士 -干杯
- To Dr. Ford. - Cheers!

907
01:29:27,291 --> 01:29:28,957
放下武器
Drop your weapon!

908
01:29:29,001 --> 01:29:30,917
放下 就现在
Drop it! Do it now!

909
01:29:32,004 --> 01:29:34,254
马上
Now!

910
01:29:43,891 --> 01:29:46,308
全员戒备
Get to the ground now!

911
01:29:49,688 --> 01:29:51,479
停止所有电机功能
Cease all motor functions.

912
01:29:52,858 --> 01:29:54,649
停止所有电机功能
Cease all motor functions!
